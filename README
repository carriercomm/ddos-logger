Initial Log File Format:

<timestamp><attacker ip><dest port><countrycode><attacked IP><src port>[<tcp payload> bzipped]

ASCII delogger

minimal grep for attacker IP, country code, number of lines

Quick instructions:

apt-get install libnids-dev libpcap-dev libgeoip-dev
git clone https://code.google.com/p/ddos-log/
cd ddos-log
cd lzfx-0.1
./configure
make
cd ..
make

You'll need to be root to run ddoslog.bin since it attaches to the ethernet card
and switches it to promiscuous mode.
